# Specific Mechanics

**Active Player**

The player whose turn it is.

* * *

### And vs Then

If an ability uses the word ‘**and**’ to link two things, it means that the second part is dependent on the first part. 

For example, if an ability said ‘Discard a loot card and loot 2.’, you would only loot 2 if you had been able to discard a loot card. The same is **not** true if the word ‘**then**’ is used. If the ability was instead worded as ‘Discard a loot card, then loot 2.’ the player would still loot 2 even if they weren’t able to discard a loot card. A period (e.g. Discard a loot card. Loot 2.) would function the same way as ‘then’, with the loot 2 not caring about what has come before it.

Remember as well that colons in effect text, except when that text is used as an indicator for a roll ability, indicate costs. The cost would have to be paid for what comes after the colon to take effect.

* * *

### Cancel

**Canceling** is an action done to things on the stack. If something is canceled, it is removed from the stack before it can resolve and therefore has no effect. If **death** is canceled, the object that would’ve died heals until it has at least 1 HP, unless otherwise specified.


* * *

### Copying

There are a few abilities in the game that can **copy** something, for example an object in play (most often an item), a loot or loot card, or just an ability.

#### **Copying an Object in Play**

When an item becomes a copy of another item, it both copies all of the copiable qualities of the card in question, and loses all of its previous copiable qualities, for the specified duration. Copiable qualities are:

*   Any abilities the card has
*   The card’s name
*   A stat block, if the card has one
*   A reward box, if the card has one
*   A soul icon, if the card has one

Anything that is tied to a specific instance of an item is not copied, however. It is easy to think of this as anything that the item wouldn’t have had when you first obtained it. For example:

*   Counters
*   Whether the item is charged or deactivated
*   Damage taken (if the card has a stat block)

In addition:

*   If the card being copied had a back face, it is not copied.
*   If a starting item is copied, the copy does not have the starting item quality.

The above principles would apply for other types of object in play, too. For example, a monster becoming a copy of another monster.

#### **Copying a Loot**

When an ability tells you to copy a **loot being played**, you create a copy of that loot on the stack. When that copy resolves, its loot ability takes effect the same as if it had been put on the stack by the loot card being played.

A copy of a loot can only exist on the stack. If you are told to put a copy of a loot into either a deck or discard zone, nothing happens.

Copying a loot doesn’t copy any targets of the original, or the choice of ability on that loot if there is one. Any targets and choices on the copy will be decided as it is put on the stack. If there was a cost to put the loot onto the stack, it is not paid again if that loot is copied.

#### **Copying a Loot Card**

**Loot cards** can also be copied by some abilities, and there is a difference between this and when a **loot** is copied (remember, **loot cards** exist in your hand, then become **loot** once they are played and put on the stack).

The ability in question will likely select a loot card, and then allow you to play a copy of that loot card, either immediately or within a set time window. The selected loot card exists in a temporary holding zone till the end point of that time window. It will cease to exist either when it is played and enters the stack, or when the time window has elapsed.

In contrast to copying a loot, the copy of the loot card still has to be played. This means you would require a loot play (or an ability that lets you play a loot) to do so, unless otherwise specified. It also means that if you copy a loot card that has a cost associated with being played, you would have to pay that cost to play the copy of the loot card.

#### **Copying an Ability**

Some abilities also let you copy another ability. When an ability is copied, that ability is simply put on the stack. It is the ability itself that is copied, and no costs associated with activating that ability would have to be paid unless otherwise specified. The ability itself must be copied in full, though.

If a loot ability were to copy an ability on an item that required the item to destroy itself, the ability will simply fizzle as a loot cannot be destroyed.

If a loot ability were to copy an ability on an item that would turn that item into a copy of another item, nothing will happen unless the ability specifically states that the loot becomes an item. Otherwise, the loot card will be moved to discard as soon as it has finished resolving just like normal, having never entered play.

* * *

### Counters

Some abilities may tell you to put **counters** on a card. Counters can be represented by anything you like (tokens, coins, dice, etc.), and are simply markers that you place on certain cards. Counters have no inherent effect on any card they are placed on, unless such an effect is defined by an ability, but there may well be an ability that takes effect when a card reaches a certain number of them. They can also serve as the activation cost for $ abilities.

Most abilities that use counters refer to generic counters. If a card says to add a **counter**, without any further specification, it means to add a generic counter. There are a number of abilities that add specific named counters to cards as well, however. Named counters still count as **counters** for any abilities that refer to them. For example, if a card has 5 generic counters and 1 named counter, an ability that takes effect when the card has 6 counters would still do so, and if an ability says to ‘remove a counter’ without further specification, then either a generic or named counter can be removed. Often other abilities will make specific named counters apply effects to a card they are put on, or the named counters will be used as markers that other abilities will interact with. Just like generic counters, named counters have no innate effect – only those which are given to them from elsewhere.

Any counters that are put on an object or card are tied to that object or card. If an object with counters on it is given to another player, or stolen by one, it keeps those counters. If an object with counters on it is copied (see **Copying**), the copy of the object will not keep those counters, as it is a different object to the original. Some items start with a certain number of counters already on them. If one of these items is copied, then the copy will start with that number of counters on it, as the ability that gives the object those starting counters is copied. Counters are tied to the object itself, not to a specific side of it, and so if an object with counters on it is flipped it keeps any counters it has.

Counters put on a **player** are tied to that specific player, and will not be removed even if their **character** changes. Counters put on a player’s **character**, however, are tied specifically to the character, **not the player**, and would be removed if the character was to change.

Any counters on an object are removed when it leaves play, unless otherwise specified. Remember, if a card becomes **covered in a slot**, it is considered to have left play.  

####   
**Special Counters**

There are a few special types of counter in Four Souls that convey an ability onto the card they are placed on without that ability having to have been defined by another ability elsewhere.

#####  **![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) Counters**

![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counters are a special type of counter. If a ![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counter is placed on an item or character, it gives that item or character the ability “You have +1![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9).” If a ![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counter is placed on a monster, it gives that monster the ability “This has +1![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9).” An object can have more than one ![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counter at a time. If an object later loses a ![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counter, it also loses the ability that ![HP](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Heart.png#9x9) counter was giving it.

#####  **![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) Counters**

![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counters are a special type of counter. If a ![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counter is placed on an item or character, it gives that item or character the ability “You have +1![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9).” If a ![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counter is placed on a monster, it gives that monster the ability “This has +1![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9).” An object can have more than one ![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counter at a time. If an object later loses a ![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counter, it also loses the ability that ![ATK](https://foursouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sword.png#9x9) counter was giving it.

##### **Eternal Counters**

Eternal counters are a special type of counter. If an eternal counter is placed on an object, it gives that object the keyworded ability **Eternal**. If an object later loses an Eternal counter, it also loses the ability that Eternal counter was giving it.

* * *

### Damage

Damage is a value applied to an object with an HP stat. Damage causes an object to lose that much HP. Damage is marked on an object when any damage on the stack resolves. For the sake of this section, a player is considered an object with HP equal to what is on their character card.

If an object with an HP stat has 0HP at any point, its death is put on **the stack** the next time any player would receive priority. `An object with 0HP can still take damage, but that damage won’t be marked on the object, and won’t make it go below 0.`

_`A player can’t choose to deal damage to a dead player, but it is possible for them to take damage from effects where the target is not chosen by a player, for example those that target all players or the player to the left or right of another player. A player can never go below 0 HP.`_

_`From Reddit: Dead players can take damage but dead players can't be *chosen* for damage. With an effect like Monstro 2's you would still deal the damage to the players to your left or right like normal even if their dead, it just does nothing since their already dead. With an effect like Isaac's you can't choose to deal damage to dead players so once all other players are dead you would have to choose to deal the damage to yourself. Same with Satan's effect, if all other players are dead and you roll a 6 you must kill yourself.`_

To **deal damage** to an object, that much damage is put on the stack targeting that object. When that damage resolves, that much damage is marked on the object (if it has more than 0 HP). The damage source is the object with the ability dealing the damage, or the controller of that same object. The damage source is only considered to have **dealt damage** when the damage resolves, not simply when it is put on the stack.

An object is considered to **take damage** whenever damage targeting it on the stack resolves. If an ability or effect says a player or object **takes damage** (e.g. “Each time a player rolls a 1, this takes 1 damage.”), that much damage is put on the stack targeting that object. When that damage resolves, that much damage is marked on the object (if it has more than 0 HP). The damage source in this case is the game. If no object is specified, there is an implicit ‘**you**’ at the start of the ability (e.g. “**Take 1 damage**” means “**You take 1 damage**”).

Any damage marked on a player is tied to the player themself rather than their character card. If that player was to switch character cards, they would retain any marked damage they had before the switch. Similarly, if a player flips their character card, they retain any damage marked on them.

You can’t deal or take 0 damage. If you miss an attack roll against a monster that has an attack stat of 0, or an ability says to deal or take 0 damage, no damage is put on the stack, and nothing happens.

If an object’s max HP is reduced, if it has any marked damage, an equal amount of damage is also removed. This is not considered healing. For example, if a player has 2 max HP and 1 marked damage (and therefore currently 1 HP remaining), 1 damage is removed if their max HP is reduced to 1 HP. This means that they would still be on 1 HP. If, for the sake of this example, we consider each point of max HP as a ‘heart container’ that can individually have one damage marked on it and become empty, it is the empty heart container that is lost when the max HP is reduced.

If an object that has damage marked on it stops having an HP stat for any reason, that damage is removed.


* * *

### Destroy and Kill

**Destroy/Kill** is an action that is done to objects in play. **Destroy** is most commonly used on items, souls, and rooms, while **kill** is most commonly used on monsters and players.

To **destroy/kill**, the object being destroyed/killed has its HP set to 0 if it has an HP stat. If the object doesn’t die despite having 0 HP, or doesn’t have an HP stat, it is moved to discard. Characters and eternal objects are not moved to discard if they are destroyed or killed.

**Die** is a related action. It means that the game **destroys/kills** a specified object in play. An object that is destroyed/killed **dies**.

* * *

### Discard

**Discard** is an action done to loot cards in hand. To discard, you move the specified number of loot cards from your hand into the loot discard.


* * *

### Each

Abilities that affect all players or objects of a certain type use the terminology of ‘each’ – e.g. “Each player loots 1.” or “Reroll each item you control.” Some abilities may also specify a more specific group, for example “Each living player” or “Each non-eternal item”. Note: The below rules on ordering also apply for any abilities that target e.g. ‘all players’ or ‘all monsters’.

When an ability instructs each player to do something, for example “Each player loots 1.”, players would carry out the effect in turn order, starting with the player who controls the ability, or the active player if the ability is controlled by the game.

If an ability targets multiple objects controlled by one player, for example “Reroll each item you control”, the player who controls the objects gets to decide the order in which the objects are affected.

If an ability targets every item in play, for example `“Reroll each item in play”, shop items are rerolled last, after each player rerolls each of their items in turn order`, starting with the player who controls the ability, or the active player if the ability is controlled by the game.

If an ability says that “Each player dies” or “Each player takes x damage”, the players will still die or take damage in turn order, starting with the player who controls the ability (or the active player if the ability is controlled by the game). This means that the deaths and instances of damage are actually added to the stack in reverse order in this case, so that they then resolve in turn order.

When an ability says that something happens to each monster, for example `“Each monster takes 1 damage”, it is the player that controls that ability that gets to choose the order`. If the ability is controlled by the game, it will be the active player who chooses.

If an ability says `“Each player and each monster dies”, monsters would die first, followed by players`. The ordering of monster and player deaths would be decided as above.

* * *

### Expand Slots

**Expanding** is an action done to shop slots, monster slots, or room slots. This is an action the game performs. To expand slots, the number of slots of the specified slot type is increased by the number specified.

* * *

### Fizzle

**Fizzling** is when a loot, ability, or dice roll is canceled by the game due to some aspect of the game state being invalid. For example, that loot or ability may have lost all of its targets (e.g. the item it is targeting is destroyed before it resolves), or its targets may have become invalid (e.g. the ability says to ‘Choose a deactivated item’ but the item targeted has been recharged by the time the ability resolves). Any unresolved attack rolls and combat damage fizzle when an attack is canceled.

* * *

### Flip

**Flip** is an action that has two meanings.

*   If a player is instructed to **flip an object**, such as an item, it means to flip it onto its back face, if it has one.
    *   If an object doesn’t have a back face, then it can’t be flipped.
    *   An object is still the same object if it flips.
    *   Only characteristics on the visible face apply.
*   If a player is instructed to **flip a dice roll**, it means to change the result of a standard D6 roll to **7 minus the current result**. On a standard D6, you can physically flip the dice to the opposite face to achieve this.

* * *

### Gaining and Giving

**Gaining** and **giving** are mechanically different. This means that if an ability checks for each time you **gain** an item, for example, it will only trigger when you **gain** that item, **not** if you are **given** it. **Stealing** and **swapping** both fall under the umbrella of **giving**, and therefore count as giving rather than gaining for the purposes of any abilities that interact with one or the other.

**Gain** is an action that is used in many contexts:

*   To **gain ¢**, you move the specified number of ¢ from the game’s ¢ pool into your own ¢ pool.
*   To **gain treasure**, you move the specified number of cards from the top of the treasure deck into play under your control.
*   To **gain an object in play** (e.g. an item or soul), you move it under your control.
    *   When an object (most likely a monster) with a reward box and soul icon dies or is destroyed, the active player gains it as a soul, unless otherwise specified (see **Monster Death**).

**Give** (and therefore **steal** and **swap**) is an action that can be done to many things:

*   Objects in play.
*   Loot cards in hand.
*   ¢ in a ¢ pool.

The following examples refer to Player A and Player B. When dealing with items, the place of either player may also be taken by the shop.

To **give**:

*   Player A moves an object of their choice from their control to Player B’s control.
*   Player A moves a loot card of their choice from their hand into Player B’s hand.
*   Player A moves a specified number of ¢ from their ¢ pool to Player B’s ¢ pool.

To **steal**:

*   Player B **gives** an object of Player A’s choice to Player A.
*   Player B **gives** a loot card of Player A’s choice to Player A.
*   Player B **gives** a specified number of ¢ to Player A.

To **swap**:

*   Player A and Player B simultaneously **give** an object they control to each other.
*   Player A and Player B simultaneously **give** a loot card to each other.

Note that both stealing and swapping involve **giving**, and therefore will count as **giving** for any abilities that look for it.

* * *

### Heal

**Heal** is an action that can be done to objects with an HP stat. An object can either be healed a specified amount, or to full HP. An object cannot be healed past its max HP. An object cannot be healed while its death is on the stack, unless that death is also prevented or canceled.

*   To heal a specified amount of HP, that much damage is removed from the healed object. 
*   To heal to full HP, all damage is removed from the healed object.

* * *

### If You Do

If an ability uses the phrase ‘If you do’, it means that the previous part of the ability must take effect for the next part to take effect. For example, if an item said ‘Destroy this. If you do, gain 25¢.’ you would only gain the 25¢ if the item had been able to be destroyed by its own ability.

* * *

### Levels

Some objects use **levels** to determine which abilities they have at any given time. You use **level counters** (`which function just like any other specific named counter`) to keep track of the level of an object.

If an object **levels up**, you put a **level counter** on that object. If an object **levels down**, you remove a **level counter** from that object, if able.

Objects that use levels will have tags that tell you which abilities the object has at a given level. For example, with Bum-bo!, the player that controls the item would get +2 to their first attack roll each turn when there are 1 or more level counters on it. When the item reaches 10 or more level counters, they then get +1 damage **in addition** to +2 to their first attack roll (as 10+ counters is still 1+ counters!). If they manage to get the item to 25+ counters, they then get the effect of the final ability as well.


* * *

### Lose ¢

**Lose ¢** is an action done to ¢ in your ¢ pool. To lose a certain number of ¢, you move that many ¢ from your ¢ pool into the game’s ¢ pool. If you don’t have the specified number of ¢, you just lose as many ¢ as possible.

* * *

### Note

Some abilities may ask you to **note** something, like a number. When you are told to **note** something, you keep track of it however you wish (e.g. you can write it down, keep track of it mentally, use counters in a way that helps you remember – whatever), either indefinitely or to a specified end point. Something that has been noted may also be cleared by an ability, meaning it is no longer noted.

Noting is used to keep track of something relevant to the function of a card. For example, an ability might trigger when a certain number of things are noted, or might check for and interact with something that has been noted (e.g. an ability that deals damage to a player if they roll a number that has been noted).

Anything that is noted is tied to the object that caused it to be noted, unless otherwise specified. For example, if two items both had you note numbers, and the number 6 was noted by Item A, an ability that checked if a 6 was noted by Item B wouldn’t find that it was (unless a 6 had also separately been noted by Item B). If an object is destroyed or otherwise put into discard, anything noted by it is cleared.

* * *

### Pay

**Pay** is an action that has two meanings. As a general rule, you can’t pay what you don’t have.

*   To pay ¢:
    *   Move that many ¢ from your ¢ pool to the specified ¢ pool. If no ¢ pool is specified, then it is moved to the game’s ¢ pool.
    *   If you don’t have enough ¢ to pay, you can’t pay.
*   To pay HP:
    *   You lose that much HP.
    *   If you don’t have enough HP to pay, you can’t pay.

* * *

### Prevent

**Prevent** is an action done to death or damage.

*   If an ability or effect instructs you to **prevent damage**, that damage is removed from the stack.
*   If an ability or effect instructs you to **prevent death**, that death is removed from the stack, and the object that would have died heals until it has at least 1 HP, unless that ability or effect specifies how much HP is healed instead.

* * *

### Reroll

**Reroll** is an action that has two meanings.

*   To reroll a **dice roll**, a player simply rolls that dice again. Note that rerolling a dice roll will modify the result of the existing roll rather than creating a second separate roll.
*   To reroll an **item**, you destroy it and, if you do, the player who controlled that item gains +1 treasure. If the item was controlled by the shop (i.e. it was a shop item), no player gains treasure. Instead the shop ‘gains the treasure’ and you put the top card of the treasure deck in the shop slot that the destroyed item was in.


* * *

### Voting

Some abilities involve **voting**. An ability that involves a **vote** will first specify who participates in the vote, for example “each player” or “each living player”. Each player involved in the vote will then cast their vote, choosing an option as specified by the ability (e.g. choosing an item in play, a player, between specified options such as right or left, etc.). Players vote in turn order, starting with the player who controls the ability. If no player controls the ability, voting will start with the active player. Once a player has cast their vote, they cannot change it.
