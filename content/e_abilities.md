# Abilities

Abilities consist of non-gray colored text, called **effect text**, that is written in a card’s text box. 

Abilities only function while an object is in play, unless otherwise specified. Loot abilities are an exception – they are performed when a loot resolves.

Targets of abilities are chosen when that ability is put onto the stack, not when it resolves. If the target is no longer valid when the ability does resolve, then that ability will **fizzle** (be canceled by the game). For example, an ability that said “Choose a deactivated item. Destroy it.” would fizzle if the chosen item isn’t still deactivated when it resolves.

Some cards give a player a choice of ability (e.g. ‘Choose one-’). This choice is made when that ability is put onto **the stack**, not when it resolves, and is made simultaneously with any targets being chosen.

It is important to make the distinction between targets chosen when an ability is put on the stack, and choices made later during the resolution of an ability. Targets chosen when an ability is put on the stack are specified after a ↷ or $ symbol, after the trigger of a triggered ability, or in the first line of a loot ability, but before the first period in that ability. Anything after that point will be performed on resolution of the ability.

For example, compare the following two similar abilities: “↷: Steal a non-eternal item from a player” and “↷: Choose a player. Steal a non-eternal item from them”. For the first, a specific item will be chosen as a target as the ability is put on the stack. If that item was to be destroyed before the ability resolved, the ability would then fizzle. For the second, a specific player will be chosen as a target as the ability is put on the stack, but the item stolen would be chosen on resolution. The ability would only fizzle if the player in question had no items left by the time it resolved.

### Costs

Some abilities have costs. Costs are any effect text that is followed by a colon, **except** when that text is used as an indicator for a roll ability.

### Activated Abilities

Activated abilities can be activated at any time a player has priority and can pay their costs, unless otherwise specified by the ability itself. Activated abilities on characters and items can only be used by the player that controls that item. `Activated abilities on rooms can only be used by the active player`.

There are two types of activated abilities: ↷ abilities and $ abilities.

↷ abilities are activated abilities that have deactivating (turning sideways 90°) the object as a cost. This is denoted by a tag with “↷” on it. ↷ abilities can only be activated if the object is charged (turned upright).

$ abilities are activated abilities that have a cost that doesn’t include a ↷. They are denoted by a tag with “$” on it. These abilities can be activated as long as the cost can be paid, even if the object is deactivated (turned sideways).

### Static Abilities

Static abilities are abilities that are always true. Static abilities don’t use the stack.

### Triggered Abilities

Triggered abilities are abilities that are put onto the stack when a condition or set of conditions are met. Triggered abilities are denoted by the words “when,” “whenever,” and “at,” or timing phrases such as “each time,” “every other time,” or “the first time”.

When a triggered ability’s conditions are met, it is put onto the stack the next time any player would receive priority. If multiple triggered abilities are triggered at once, any abilities controlled by the game (such as triggered abilities on monsters) are put on the stack first in an order decided by the active player. Any abilities controlled by players are put onto the stack next. This happens in turn order, starting from the active player. If any one player controls multiple triggered abilities that trigger at the same time, they get to choose the order those abilities are put onto the stack.

Some triggered abilities have circled numbers. This indicates that these abilities trigger whenever any roll resolves as that circled number regardless of the context in which that roll was made. Other triggered abilities without circled numbers have more specific conditions, for example they might only trigger on attack rolls of 5, rather than any roll of 5.

### Loot Abilities

Any ability written on a loot card is a loot ability, unless it’s a triggered ability, activated ability, or static ability. Loot abilities are performed when the loot resolves.

### Keyworded Abilities

Some abilities are represented by a keyword. These keywords carry specific meanings and may fall under any of the ability categories.

**Eternal:** Eternal is a static ability that means “This object can’t be destroyed or put into discard.” Eternal only functions on objects in play.

**Trinket:** Trinket is a triggered ability that appears on loot cards that means “When this loot resolves, it becomes an item. Gain it.” Trinket only functions while on the stack. Unless otherwise specified, all other effect text on a trinket only functions while in play.

**Ambush:** Ambush is a triggered ability that appears on loot cards that means “When this loot resolves, choose a monster slot. This becomes a monster in that slot. The active player must make an additional attack against it this turn.” Ambush only functions while on the stack. Unless otherwise specified, all other effect text on an ambush only functions while in play.

**Guppy:** Guppy is a static ability. It has no function other than to be a marker for other cards to look for.

**Curse:** Curse represents two triggered abilities. The first is “When this enters play, it becomes a curse. The active player chooses a player. That player gains this.” The second is “When you die, put this into discard.”

**Indomitable:** Indomitable represents two static abilities. It appears on monster cards. The first is “If this would be put in a monster slot, instead expand monster slots by 1 and put this in that slot.” The second is “This can’t be covered.”

**Roll-:** Roll abilities are denoted by the text “roll-”. Roll abilities create a dice roll and a triggered ability that checks the result of the dice roll created by the roll ability. Roll abilities are put onto the stack after the ability that created them resolves. The triggered ability is always put onto the stack after the roll is made. Both the dice roll and the triggered ability created are considered to be controlled by the player who makes the dice roll.

**Team Up:** Team Up is a triggered ability that means “After each attack roll the active player makes against this, each other chosen player makes an attack roll against this in turn order.” Unless otherwise specified, this triggered ability lasts until the end of that attack.

**Familiar:** Familiar represents a static ability that means “This item can be attacked.”
