# Setup
1. Shuffle the Treasure, Loot, Monster, Room Decks. Set aside space for a discard zone next to each of these decks.
2. Fill two **shop slots** with the top two cards of the treasure deck.
3. Fill two **monster slots** with the top two cards of the Monster Deck. Place any event cards on the bottom of the deck and replace them with the top card of the Monster Deck.
4. Fill one **room slot** with the top card of the Room Deck.
5. If you are playing with **bonus souls**, shuffle them, and pick 3 at random. Those 3 are the **active bonus souls** for the game and are placed face-up next to the play area.
6. Deal a random character card (and it's character’s starting item card) to each player. *Characters start the game deactivated, while starting items start the game charged*
7. Abilities that trigger at the start of the game trigger (for example Eden’s triggered ability). No one has priority here and so these abilities will all resolve instantly.
8. Deal 3 loot cards and 3¢ to each player. Each player puts the loot cards in their **hand**.
9. Finally, the saddest player goes first! You can also each roll a dice: lowest roll goes first!.


# Bartering

Any number of ¢ can be traded for almost any favor, but both players involved always have to agree to the deal. Players can’t trade items or loot cards. Bartering doesn’t use the stack.

You don’t need to keep your promises.


# Winning the Game

By default, a player needs to control a soul value of 4 to win. Winning in this way does not use the stack and is checked between things resolving on the stack. Effects can modify the soul value needed to win.

If more than one player wins at the same time, the game ends with a tie between those players.
