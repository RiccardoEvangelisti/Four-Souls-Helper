# Dice Rolls

**The Anatomy of a Dice Roll**

You will frequently need to roll a dice, either when making attack rolls, or when told to by various abilities and loot cards. All rolls use a D6. A dice roll can never go above 6 or below 1. If you try and add 1 to a roll of 6, it simply stays a 6. If you try and subtract 1 from a roll of 1, it simply stays a 1.

Dice rolls act in a unique way on the stack, which is detailed below:

Step 1: First, when a player is instructed to roll a dice, they roll it before putting it on the stack. If that player is instructed to roll more than one dice, they are rolled at this time.

Step 2: After it is put on the stack, abilities that trigger from a dice being rolled trigger.

Step 3: While it is on the stack abilities and loot can modify the roll.

Step 4: After all players pass priority, the roll will attempt to resolve. Any abilities that trigger when a player would roll a number trigger here. If that ability changes the result of the roll, return to step 3.

Step 5: As the roll resolves, any continuous effects that modify dice rolls change the result of the roll. At this point, the roll is resolved and nothing can be done to it. Any abilities that trigger when a player rolls a number trigger.
